# Project Euler Notebook
I prepared this python notebook for everyone new to Python. It contains suggested solutions for Project Euler problems. For those who don't know what is Project Euler, here is a brief introduction and explanation of this project:

**Project Euler** is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

**Note: I will keep updating the file whenever I have time to prepare, solve and code new problems. Feel free to email me whenever you have a specific problem, correction or suggestion from [here](http://www.aelhoud.me) 

# A notebook?
Instead of sharing the code only, I thought of preparing a whole python notebook (using Google Colab and Latex). It is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media. I think this notebook is dedicated specifically for the new learners
